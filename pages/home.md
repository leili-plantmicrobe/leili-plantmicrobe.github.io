We are interested in the molecular mechanism of plant-microbe interaction. Focusing on plant and fungi interaction, we try to understand the infection processes of pathogenic fungi, as well as molecular details underlying plant-endophytic fungi interaction. We employ a variety of approaches including molecular genetics, biochemistry, functional genomics, and cell biology to investigate co-evolution between plants and microbes.
<br/>
<br/>
The lab will be situated at the Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences from 2021. The lab is new, and we are always eager to hear from enthusiastic researchers from any related backgrounds interested in joining the lab.
